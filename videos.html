<b> Thirty-Six Lectures on Equivariant Cohomology </b> </a>
  

<br />
<br />
In the spring of 2017, I gave a series of thirty-six lectures on equivariant 
cohomology at National Taiwan University and National Center for Theoretical
Sciences (NCTS), Taipei, Taiwan. NCTS taped and uploaded them to YouTube.
The sound quality is good, but it
is usually impossible to see what's written on the blackboard.
Some lectures were not complete, for example, 
Lecture 2. I put a link to the lectures here, because some students have found
them helpful.  You can find most of the lectures by searching for "An Introduction
to Equivariant Cohomology". Everything in the lectures is in my new book 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Lectures-Equivariant-Cohomology-Mathematics/
dp/0691191751/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Loring+Tu&qid=1566435699&s=books&sr=1-4">
    <i> Introductory Lectures on Equivariant Cohomology </i></a>, 
    Annals of Mathematics
Studies 204, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2020.
The chapters of the book correlate fairly closely with the lectures.

<b> Twenty-Nine Lectures on Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology </b> </a>
  

<br />
<br />
In the spring of 2024, I gave a series of twenty-nine lectures on differential forms
in algebraic topology at National Taiwan University and National Center for Theoretical
Sciences (NCTS), Taipei, Taiwan. NCTS taped and uploaded them to YouTube.
The video quality is much improved over the equivariant cohomology lectures from 2017.
The lectures start simply with differential forms on R^n and end with the Leray spectral sequence of
a fiber bundle.   They correspond roughly to the first three chapters of the book

<b>Speech at the Charles Tu Symposium, UCSD</b> </a>
<br />

<br />
Charles Tu is my elder brother.  This symposium was in his honor on the 
occasion of his retirement from the University of California at San Deigo 
(UCSD) on June 2, 2018. 
He was Professor and Chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering and Associate Dean of the Jacob School of Engineering at UCSD. 
I spoke about the trials and tribulations of having a superachieving older
brother.
